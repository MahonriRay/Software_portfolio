# Overview

This is a small little project I made to get my software portfolio up and running.

The purpose of this program was so that I can get familiar with how projects in this portfolio are to be structured.

# Development Environment

I used Python in this project. Real simple, wasn't anything too complex about creating a program that says hello world.
