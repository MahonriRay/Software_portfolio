# Overview


The goal of this project was for me to become more familiar with the JavaScript langauge. I chose to use JavaScript for this project becuase I see a lot of tech stacks that use react or TypeScript and wanted to familiarize myself with the syntax of JavaScript so that when I use frameworks or other languages that build off of JavaScript I'll have some understanding of what might be in front of me.  
  
The software I created was a simple command line application that imitates a slot machine. I am not a gambler myself, but this project taught me quite a decent amount of JavaScript. The software asks the user to deposit money which will be used to place bets on the rows of the machine. The program will then display the rows similar to what you would see from an actual slot machine. From there it will check to see if any of the rows are matching and from there will reward the user with their winnings.  


I'm nowhere near fully understanding the language, but because of this project, I am more understanding of how JavaScript can be used for different applications. My purpose, as I touched on up above, was because I see how widely JavaScript is being used in the Computer Science field currently and believe being well versed in this language could only benefit me.

# Development Environment

  
For this project I worked entirely in Visual Studio Code. With the use of NodeJS I was able to use the "Prompt" library in which I could get input from the user. NodeJS also made it super simple setting up this project to the point where I can't entirely remember how to set up another project because it was that seamless.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Check diagonally to see if symbols match
- Take it out of the command line and implement it online with the use of HTML and CSS
- Change symbols from simple letters to more appealing graphics
