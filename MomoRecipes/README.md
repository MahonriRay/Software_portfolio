# Overview  

This is a project that comes from an idea I have had for a long time. I come from a family of seven and as we've gotten older have had a harder time keeping track of all the family recipes. The idea of this app is to be able to store recipes and share them with each other. Especially since we are spread out and aren't always able to track down a recipe from whoever in our family has it at the time. The Momo Recipes app allows users to view stored recipes, as well as organize them and even add new recipes. There are a ton of similar apps out there, but this app is super simple to use and can store recipes from the internet, or simply recipes you manually input.

# Development Environment

For the application I wrote it using the Xcode IDE and with the swift programming language. Xcode was very useful in not only identifying when code wouldn't compile but also at times giving suggestions to fix the problem.  

Swift is a programming language that took me a bit to grasp, but with the experience I have gained, I see how powerful it can be. It will take a littl bit to get used to, but I look forward to working more on iOS apps in the future.

# Future Work

* Add a database, such as Firebase so that recipes are considated
* Be able to edit recipes. Change directions, add a photo, etc..
* Customize Home View so favorite recipes can be pinned, or relevant recipes can be easily located by each other. Such as main dishes with sides and desserts, creating a meal space without having to hunt down each recipe everytime.
